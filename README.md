# Vapm
- A library for PHP about Async, Promise, Coroutine, Thread, GreenThread and other non-blocking methods.
- The method is based on Fibers & Generator & Processes, requires you to have php version from >= 8.1

# Version
- Parallel/Concurrent: `1.8.0` includes: ```async await, promise, coroutines, threads, ...```
- Express: `1.0.0-ALPHA5` This is package like JavaScript.

# Next update?
- Simply add some other asynchronous features so that this library is as similar to Javascript & Kotlin as possible.
- If you have any features you'd like to contribute or have any ideas, please give me feedback. I will always update this project in the near future.
