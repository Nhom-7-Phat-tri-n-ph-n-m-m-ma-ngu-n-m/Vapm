# Vapm
- A library for PHP about Async, Promise, Coroutine and other non-blocking methods.
- The method is based on Fibers & Generator, requires you to have php version from >= 8.1

# Next update?
- Simply add some other asynchronous features so that this library is as similar to Javascript & Kotlin as possible.
- If you have any features you'd like to contribute or have any ideas, please give me feedback. I will always update this project in the near future.
